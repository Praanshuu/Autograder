# Research & Logic: The Science of Learning (Foundational Resources)

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Topic:** Cognitive Science & Educational Psychology
**Purpose:** A guide to understanding *how* students learn, think, and engage.

## 1. The Core Question: "How do we make them think?"
You mentioned you "don't see yourself thinking." That is likely because you have reached **Automaticity**. 
*   **Novices** have to think about syntax (`for i in range...`).
*   **Experts** think about *problems* ("I need to iterate here").
*   **The Goal**: HELP students bridge the gap from "Syntax Struggle" to "Problem Solving".

## 2. Key Mental Models for Research

### A. Cognitive Load Theory (The "Brain RAM" Limit)
*   **Concept**: The brain has limited "working memory" (RAM). If a student is overwhelmed by the *tool* (clunky LMS, confusing buttons), they have zero RAM left for the *problem*.
*   **Application**: This is why we need a clean, "Focus Mode" dashboard. We must reduce **Extraneous Load** (bad UI) so they can focus on **Germane Load** (learning the concept).
*   **Distracted Students**: They have lower working memory thresholds. Any UI distraction breaks their train of thought.

### B. The Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky)
*   **Concept**: Learning happens in the "Sweet Spot":
    *   Too Easy = Boredom.
    *   Too Hard = Anxiety/Giving Up.
    *   **Just Right** (The Zone) = Growth.
*   **Application**: The "Rubber Duck AI" shouldn't give the answer (boring) nor say nothing (anxiety). It should give a *hint* that pushes them just enough to solve it themselves.

### C. Self-Determination Theory (Motivation)
Why do students care? Three drivers:
1.  **Autonomy**: "I chose to do this." (Allowing them to pick which problem to solve first).
2.  **Competence**: "I am getting better." (The Knowledge Map / Visual Mastery).
3.  **Relatedness**: "I am part of a group." (Peer Q&A, Class Stream).

## 3. Recommended Reading Path

### Level 1: The Essentials (Start Here)
1.  **"Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning"** (Book)
    *   *Why*: Explains why "rereading notes" fails and why "testing yourself" (Retrieval Practice) works. This justifies our "Low Stakes Quizzes" approach.
2.  **"Design for How People Learn"** by Julie Dirksen
    *   *Why*: Written for UX designers. very practical. Explains "The Elephant vs The Rider" (Emotional vs Rational brain).

### Level 2: Coding Specific
3.  **"Mindstorms"** by Seymour Papert
    *   *Why*: The bible of coding education. Papert invented "Constructionism" (learning by building). He argues computers shouldn't program children; children should program computers.
4.  **"The Programmer's Brain"** by Felienne Hermans
    *   *Why*: Explains specifically how we read code. Why "variable names" matter. How to teach "Chunking".

### Level 3: Deep Dive
5.  **Bloom's Taxonomy** (Google Search)
    *   The hierarchy of learning: *Remember* -> *Understand* -> *Apply* -> *Analyze* -> *Evaluate* -> *Create*.
    *   Our "Autograder" usually stops at *Apply*. We want features that hit *Evaluate* (Reflection prompts).

## 4. How to Research This Yourself
1.  **Search Terms**: Instead of "LMS features", search for:
    *   "Metacognitive scaffolding in CS education"
    *   "Gamification vs Game-Based Learning"
    *   "Flow state in programming"
2.  **Observe**: Watch a complete beginner try to code. Don't help them. Just watch *where* their eyes look. Do they look at the error message? Do they ignore it? You will learn more from 10 minutes of observation than 10 hours of guessing.

## 5. Summary
To answer "How to make them think?":
We must design an environment that **safely permits failure**. Thinking is messy. If we punish every syntax error with a big red "FAIL", they stop thinking and start guessing. If we visualize their error as a "path diverged", they start investigating.

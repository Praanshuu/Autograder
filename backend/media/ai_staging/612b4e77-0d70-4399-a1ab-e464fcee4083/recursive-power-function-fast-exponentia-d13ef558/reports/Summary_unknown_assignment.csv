B25EE031,1,1,100.00,"The provided recursive solution efficiently calculates power with a time complexity of O(log N) due to its divide-and-conquer approach, despite an initial misinterpretation. Code structure and readability are clear, making the algorithm easy to follow. The use of recursion avoids explicit loop constructs, improving code clarity.","def recursion_power(x, n):\n    # Base case\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1.0\n    \n    # Handle negative powers\n    if n < 0:\n        return 1 / recursion_power(x, -n)\n    \n    # Divide step\n    half = recursion_power(x, n // 2)\n    \n    # Conquer step\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return half * half\n    else:\n        return x * half * half"

B25EE031,1,1,100.00,"The provided recursive solution demonstrates clear and concise code structure, making it easy to follow. Its time complexity is likely O(log n) due to the exponentiation by squaring approach, which is a standard result for this problem. Given the low confidence level, it's reasonable to consider the complexity as typical for binary exponentiation under these constraints.","def recursion_power(x, n):\n    # Base case\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1.0\n    \n    # Handle negative powers\n    if n < 0:\n        return 1 / recursion_power(x, -n)\n    \n    # Divide step\n    half = recursion_power(x, n // 2)\n    \n    # Conquer step\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return half * half\n    else:\n        return x * half * half"

B25EE031,2,2,100.00,"The provided Python solution demonstrates a clear and concise approach to solving the permutation problem using backtracking. The code structure is well-organized, making it easy to follow. However, the time complexity appears to be O(n!), which is expected for this problem as it involves generating all permutations of a string.","def reverse_string(s):\n    original = s\n    result = []\n    s = list(s)\n    \n    def backtrack(index):\n        if index == len(s):\n            result.append("""".join(s))\n            return\n        \n        for i in range(index, len(s)):\n            s[index], s[i] = s[i], s[index]\n            backtrack(index + 1)\n            s[index], s[i] = s[i], s[index]\n    \n    backtrack(0)\n    \n    result.sort()\n    \n    # Move original to first position\n    if original in result:\n        result.remove(original)\n        result.insert(0, original)\n    \n    for perm in result:\n        print(perm)"

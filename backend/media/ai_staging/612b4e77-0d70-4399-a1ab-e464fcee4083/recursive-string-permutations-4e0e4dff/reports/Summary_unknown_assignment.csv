B25EE031,2,2,100.00,"The student's solution is well-structured, with clear variable names and a logical backtrack approach. However, the time complexity appears to be O(n!), which is impractically high due to the use of permutations without pruning. This complexity is likely reasonable for typical constraints but may not scale well for large inputs.","def reverse_string(s):\n    original = s\n    result = []\n    s = list(s)\n    \n    def backtrack(index):\n        if index == len(s):\n            result.append("""".join(s))\n            return\n        \n        for i in range(index, len(s)):\n            s[index], s[i] = s[i], s[index]\n            backtrack(index + 1)\n            s[index], s[i] = s[i], s[index]\n    \n    backtrack(0)\n    \n    result.sort()\n    \n    # Move original to first position\n    if original in result:\n        result.remove(original)\n        result.insert(0, original)\n    \n    for perm in result:\n        print(perm)"
